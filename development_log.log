First thought should include
-- recording all useful algorithms
-- stored in json files
-- a json file for every category
-- able to add, edit an entries
-- initial version: parameter for every entry: name, last edit time(current time), description, example exists?, implemented function exsist?
-- should be able to retrieve examples and impletented functions
-- one folder for all examples and one folder for implemented functions
-- should support pictures in the future
-- should be able to open from terminal

-- algos json file:
            "0": {
                "name": "test",
                "last_edited_time": "2022/06/11 11:53:00",
                "descirption": "Test case",
                "example": [],
                "function": []
            },
-- records json file:
{
        "0":"test",
        "1":"test1",
        "2":"test2"
}
-- every algorithm should have an unique ID
