-- a json file for every category
-- able to add, edit an entries
-- initial version: parameter for every entry: name, last edit time(current time), description, example exists?, implemented function exsist?
-- should be able to retrieve examples and impletented functions
-- one folder for all examples and one folder for implemented functions

-- algos json file:
{
    "id":1,
    "name":"test1",
    "last_edited_time":"2022/06/11 11:53:00",
    "descirption":"Test case 1",
    "example":[
        
    ],
    "function":[
        
    ]
}
-- records json file:
{
    "id":0,
    "name":"test"
}
-- every algorithm should have an unique ID
